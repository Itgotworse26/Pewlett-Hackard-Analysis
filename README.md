# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Practice and Challenge Assignment for Module 7 

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the size of the “silver tsunami”; the bloc of current employees reaching retirement age, and determine the trajectory of a strategy to make sure that the impact of the retirements are not detrimental to Pewlett-Hackard.

## Results
According to the retiring_titles query, the breakdown of the “silver tsunami” by position are as follows:

* 29414 senior engineers    
* 28254 senior staff    
* 14222 engineers    
* 12243 staff    
* 4502 technique leaders    
* 1761 assistant engineers     
* 2 managers    

Meanwhile, the the breakdown of employees eligible for mentorship according to the mentorship_titles query are as follows:

* 568 senior staff  
* 501 engineers    
* 169 senior engineers    
* 156 staff    
* 78 assistant engineers
* 77 technique leaders    

## Summary
Just from looking at this breakdown, a one-on-one mentorship program would be impratical due to the massive size gap between retiring staff and employees eligible for mentorship.
